# About me

Hi, my name is Den or Denis, or as I like to call myself, Den_loob.

My main language is Python, but I also know JavaScript, C++ and C#, yet, I believe that it would not take me or any experienced programmer much time to learn most languages from scratch. I have experience with web development and I coded in some joke languages like BF.
I have experience in using Linux and Windows.

My native language is Russian, but I also speak English, Hebrew and Ukrainian.

# A little bit about me:

I started to get interested in programming when I was 4 years old, but I thought it was too complicated and I will start learning when I'm an adult, and even though I always dreamt of becoming a programmer it seemed more like a hobby in addition to my business of selling games some of which I will create myself. As time went by I began to realize that running a business was not that simple and that I was more interested in programming but immigration and school got me away from that dream. One day my computer science teacher was absent and the substitute teacher gave us a little python lesson. I was learning JavaScript at the time and wanted to start learning Java but python really threw me off, starting from the fact that I had heard more about Java and ending with the fact that it threw an error when concatenating strings and numbers, but in spite of this within six months I wrote my first game and to my surprise in python.

In the seventh grade I was accepted into the group that programmed and maintained the school website and a few months later into the Intel Artificial Intelligence project, where I learned the basics of this industry.

Between eighth and ninth grade I released a simple game on android and wrote a prototype of a chatbot in python, but since I found it very complicated I got frustrated and decided to take a break from programming.

In ninth grade I was invited to join a more advanced AI project, [AI4Y](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate/artificial-intelligence/ai-for-youth.html), in which my team and I decided to write KNN based AI that would be able to translate ASL to English. We used Flask for the backend and TensorFlowJS on the frontend. Python library by google was used to track hands, that were sent to the server that would return the ASL translation. Our project was a success, we were the best team in our city, won in the final competition in Israel.

# My hobbies

My main hobby is programming, for example I am playing a game named [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) in which I need to write an AI bot with [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) that will mine resources, build structures and survive among other players. You can find my [first bot](https://github.com/Denloob/dci-screeps) on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Denloob).

Also I love plaing video games. Most of them online so I can play them with friends, or logic-based like puzzles, strategy and etc. For example I am playing [GreyHack](https://greyhack.net/), [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) on pc and [hoplite](http://www.magmafortress.com/p/hoplite.html) on my phone.

In addition to programming I also like to play on piano, draw pixel arts and play with my cat.

_P.s. he is the best cat ever._
