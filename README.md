# A little bit about me:

I started to get interested in programming when I was 4 years old, but I thought it was too complicated and I will start learning when I'm an adult, and even though I always dreamt of becoming a programmer it seemed more like a hobby in addition to my business of selling games some of which I will create myself. As time went by I began to realize that running a business was not that simple and that I was more interested in programming immigration and school got me away from that dream. One day my computer science teacher was absent and the substitute teacher gave us a little python lesson. I was learning javascript at the time and wanted to start learning java but python really threw me off, starting from the fact that I had heard more about java and ending with the fact that it threw an error when concatenating strings and numbers, but in spite of this within six months I wrote my first game and to my surprise in python.

In the seventh grade I was accepted into the group that programmed and maintained the school website and a few months later into the Intel Artificial Intelligence project, where I learned the basics of this industry.

Between eighth and ninth grade I released a simple game on android and wrote a prototype of a chat bot in python, but since I found it too complicated I decided to take a break from programming.

In ninth grade I was invited to join a more advanced AI project, [AI4Y](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate/artificial-intelligence/ai-for-youth.html) in which my team and I decided to write an AI based on KNN that would be able to conver ASL to English, and we used it to make a ASL keyboard, which we implemented to my friend's chattiing app.

# My hobbies

My main hobby is programming, for example I am playing a game named [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) in which I need to write a bot with [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) that will mine resources, build structures and survive among other players. You can find my first bot on [GitHub](https://github.com/Denloob/dci-screeps).

Also I love plaing video games. Most of them online so I can play them with friends, or logic-based like puzzles, strategy and etc. For example I am playing [GreyHack](https://greyhack.net/), [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) on pc and [hoplite](http://www.magmafortress.com/p/hoplite.html) on my phone.

In addition to programming I also like to play on piano, draw pixel arts and play with my cat.

_P.s. he is the best cat ever._
